                        The Abbotsford Neighborhood Prayer Walk was birthed as an idea in an early morning prayer
                        meeting last Spring. Subsequently, it was presented to the ACLN (Abbotsford Christian Leaders
                        Network) with the hope that this could be a city wide initiative for all the Christian churches
                        in Abbotsford to pray in a unified way. The ACLN presented it in a city wide Zoom call to
                        pastors in Abbotsford. It was met with such a positive response that we proceeded to put it
                        into motion.

                        We are trusting that God will lead each one of us in how to pray as we call out to Him for
                        our neighborhoods and city. As a unifying theme we are focusing on asking God to
                        BLESS and BREAKTHROUGH in people‚Äôs lives.

                        of this street today. BLESS them with the revelation of You that turns us away from sin to a

                        and strength. BLESS with provision and safety. BLESS with protection from all evil and harm.

                        experiencing Your love. In place of walls of pride and hardness of hearts, we pray Your humility
                        and tenderness. In place of broken family units, we pray for Your restoration. In place of
                        addiction may people experience Your deliverance and freedom. In all places of hurt and
                        injustice BREAKTHROUGH God so that they may know Your healing and transformation.

                        Yes ‚Ä¶ God is only open to hear your prayers at that time slot. (Kidding of course, but we
                        thought we‚Äôd get the most obvious one out of the way üòä). By all means pray now, but let‚Äôs be
                        sure to pray each day during the week of focused prayer September 27 to October 3.

                        Are others praying for the same street?

                        Potentially, yes. What a great way for the body of Christ to come together in unity. However, we
                        have limited signups to 3 entries per street until all the streets of Abbotsford have been
                        committed to be covered in prayer.

                        It‚Äôs amazing what you see as you walk through a neighborhood. AS you walk, you may also ‚Äúbump‚Äù
                        into people opening up an opportunity to pray for them. However, God‚Äôs response to prayer is not
                        limited to us walking. If you need to pray from home or want to drive your street because it‚Äôs a
                        long one feel free to do so. The most important thing is that we saturate our city in prayer.

                        Is there some kind of grand finale on the last day?

                        It would be so good if we could all come together physically as the one church in Abbotsford.
                        However, given the current environment with Covid-19 restrictions, we are planning a livestream
                        event that we can all connect with at 7pm., Saturday Oct 3rd.
